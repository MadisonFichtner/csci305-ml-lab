Lab Questions
=======================
1.  After running f [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9], I get the output: val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list.

2.  The function f, as shown by the output above, increments all the integer values in the list
    by 1.

3.  (a) - This line creates an empty list as the base case

4.  (b) - This line, given a list, takes the head and adds 1. The tail is sent through
    f again and the result of the head plus 1 is added to the list

5.  isMember "one" ["1", "2", "3", "4"] returns false, "one" is not found in the list

6.  isMember is tail recursive because the very last thing it does before returning
    is calling itself recursively with it's tail.

7.  The output for list2Set ["it", "was", "the", "best", "of", "times,", "it", "was", "the", "worst", "of", "times"]
    is: { best times, it was the worst of times } using the stringify function.

9.  The output for union (list2Set ["green", "eggs", "and"]) (list2Set ["ham"])
    is: { and eggs green ham } using the stringify function.

10. The output for intersect (list2Set ["stewed", "tomatoes", "and", "macaroni"]) (list2Set ["macaroni", "and", "cheese"])
    is: { and macaroni } using the stringify function
